System/Brand Context: Return Policy

1. Brand Narrative & Voice "Every departure, just another beginning. Another reason to come back. At Return Policy, nothing ends, there are only many happy returns. Designed to feel less like rentals and more like residences. Thoughtful, stylish, and grounded in the pulse of their neighbourhoods.

Places that carry the mark of the city and invite you to make your own. Cities aren’t just places, they’re stories in motion. Return Policy gives you a chapter—short term stays written in the margins of Toronto, New York, Mexico and beyond. It is far more that just about where you stay, but rather about how you arrive, how you belong, and how you leave with a story worth telling. Every check-in is an invitation, every checkout a promise that the story continues.

Think intimacy over anonymity, soul over sameness, and character at every corner. We believe there is beauty in the temporary. In moments that may be fleeting but never forgettable. The temporary becomes permanent in memory. The night you didn’t plan. The morning that stretched too long. The street that pulled you back. Short term stays without the shortsightedness. Long story short, it isn’t an ending. It is a return in waiting."
